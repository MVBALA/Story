The Heroku CLI keeps itself and its plugins (except linked plugins) up to date automatically, unless you installed the Debian/Ubuntu package or used npm install.

When you run a heroku command, a background process checks for the latest available version of the CLI. If a new version is found, itâ€™s downloaded and stored in ~/.local/share/heroku/client. This background check happens at most once every 4 hours.

The heroku binary checks for an up-to-date client in ~/.local/share/heroku/client before using the originally installed client.
